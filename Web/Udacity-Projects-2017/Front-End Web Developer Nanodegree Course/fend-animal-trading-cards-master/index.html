			<p>Golden Retriever is a dog breed originating in the United Kingdom. It gives a healthy and refreshing feeling to the muscular body. It has gold shiny hair, the undercoat is waterproof and the outer is resilient. They were trained to find their prey.
				The whitish and undercoat protects the body from the cold and the water, so it can bite well in the water. You can swim well, smell well and train easily. It is big, but if you hide the feces, you can raise it in the house.</p>
